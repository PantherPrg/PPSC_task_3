# PPSC_task_3: Transaction Record 
**| difficulty: 5/10 |**

You started a bank. The first one, in fact. So primitive that it doesn't include taxes or any other sort of other fees. Just that it stores money for different accounts and has two services of depositing and drawing. You need to find the amount of money this account has by the end of all of these transactions. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
You are given a list, the first item being the amount of money you initially have in your account. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:
Make sure to add a newline at the end of your returned answer. This is needed to match the format for the task result.

This problem deals with lists, finding values using the indexes of a list, casting datatypes, for loops, and if statements. This task will help you get comfortable with using lists.

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. If multiple people have the same obstacles, we would be able to go over them during the club. 

Otherwise, you can use https://tutorialdeep.com/knowhow/get-list-element-by-index-python/ for getting items in a list using indexes, https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp for for loops, and https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_if_statement.asp for if statements.
